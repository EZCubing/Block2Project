The purpose of this repository is to spread the word about whatsthemove.us. This is a project I made with one of my closest friends from back home. Whats the move is Tailored specifically for college students, this web based application serves as a resource to students for discovering events on and off campus. There may be an initial loading time of ~30 seconds because we are running the website on a free server. Currently the option to log in with Snapchat is being developed with the API. When prompted to log in, please click "Remind Me Later" to bypass this step and continue. Type â€œUniversity of Utah" to find the most packed page. The project will eventually have every school that you see on the home page. This project is currently on the open web and I encourage anyone reading this to check it! Remember to let it give it 30 seconds to load.
